# Timestamp-Service

### Background

---

This is an open-ended project for implementing a Microservice. In this case, I'm constructing a service that appears to take in parameters
for a timestamp, and produces a JSON-formatted result, with entries for the input time converted to UNIX and UTC.

The functionality for this site should be similar to [this](https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/).
